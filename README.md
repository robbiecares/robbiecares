Hi,

I’m Rob, a pythonista in training! I'm currently interested in learning Python so that I can do cool things like analyze datasets, automate tasks on my PC and develop websites. I hope to one day work as a developer. Aside from this, my other hobbies include cooking, living sustainably and attempting to follow US politics.
I document my code learning on a website I've created, https://robbiecares.herokuapp.com/. It's not much at the moment but it will improve as I continue to learn. If you're interested in learning more about me or one of my projects, send me a pull request or contact me at robbiecares@gmail.com.
