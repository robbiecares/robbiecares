Hi,

I’m Rob, a pythonista in training who hopes to one day be a professional developer. I'm currently interested in learning Python so that I can do cool things like analyze datasets, automate tasks on my PC and develop websites. Aside from this, my other hobbies include cooking, living sustainably and attempting to follow US politics.
I document my code learning on a [website](https://robbiecares.herokuapp.com/) I've created. It's not much at the moment but it will improve as I continue to learn. If you're interested in learning more about me or one of my projects, feel free to contact me or send a pull request.
